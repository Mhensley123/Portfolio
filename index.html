    <p>Future TrueCoders alum with knowledge of C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, ASP.net, Python, GitHub, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code.
        Like to switch things up so fullstack engineering is my preference. Have a natural flare for style, decor and fashion so FrontEnd is a niche.

    <section><h1>Taco Bell Parser 2023</h1>
    </section>
    <P>
        Used C# to create a parser to find the greatest distance between Taco Bells. The Taco Parser used geolocation, csv parsing, and logging. The C# parser began with a unit test to test the method. 
        Implemented the methods using functions such as if else, do while, string interpolation, interface, and classes to help parse the method. 
        Used Geo Coordinates to find the longitude, latitude, and name of the different Taco Bell locations to compare the distances and find the locations with the greatest distance between the restaurants.
